### Introduction

Welcome to the **UK Electricity Demand Dashboard**, this dashboard provide insights into electricity consumption patterns and energy source contributions in the UK. The data is sourced from Gridwatch, an open-source dataset that tracks real-time electricity demand data for the UK.
